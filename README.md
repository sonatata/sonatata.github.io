A personal website with a custom domain. Used as a playground to try new webdev and frontend ideas.

## Built With
* [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - a static site hosting service designed to host your personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository.
* [Google Domains](https://domains.google/#/) -  a domain registration service offered by Google.
* [ParticleJS](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) - a lightweight JavaScript library for creating particles.
* [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) -  a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic.

## future goals:
* host a blog using [Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-as-a-static-site-generator-with-github-pages/)
* fix css so that the particles are responsive everywhere
* make particles change color onClick
